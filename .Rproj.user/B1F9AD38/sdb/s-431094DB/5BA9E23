Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n\nWhen you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n```{r cars}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\n## Including Plots\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}\nplot(pressure)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
